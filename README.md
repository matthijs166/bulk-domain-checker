# Bulk check domain availability

## Usage
- Add domains inside `domainsToCheck.txt` file
- Run `node index.js`
- See `freeDomains.txt` file for available domains

## Disclaimer for future me
Didn't have time to write it properly, so it's a bit messy. But...

If it ain't broke, don't fix it! ðŸ¥²

p.s. it works only for .nl tld :X

## Wish list
- Use it as an CLI
